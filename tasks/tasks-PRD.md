### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing or in a dedicated `tests/` directory.
- Use `pytest` to run tests: `pytest tests/` to run all tests or `pytest tests/test_data.py` for specific test files.
- Model checkpoints will be saved in `models/checkpoints/` and final models in `models/final/`.
- Raw datasets will be stored in `data/raw/`, processed data in `data/processed/`, and train/validation/test splits in `data/splits/`.
